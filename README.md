Draw shit.

## Reflection
- Another stall that took longer than expected.
- Had to search so much about events which was kinda overwhelming. 
- Was fucking stuck on *e.style* because I forgot you needed backticks for them so that was frustrating.
- I had to read so much on how grid columns worked, but wow!, you just needed backticks!
- Backticks, single quotes, double quotes, so fucking annoying.
- Also, I gave up on that stupid hover thing, so it only works for black, and might not work even when it's black. *~might come back to this, 08/03/22*.
